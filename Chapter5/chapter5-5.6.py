##Suppose that you have the following list: x = [[1, 2,
##3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] What code could you use to get a copy y of
##that list in which you could change the elements without the side effect of
##changing the contents of x?

import copy
x = [[1, 2,3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
y=copy.deepcopy(x)
print(y)
y[1][1]="a"
print(y , x)
